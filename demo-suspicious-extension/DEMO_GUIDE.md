cd "/Users/kraj/Desktop/Company-code/Static Analysis/kr_vscode"
code --install-extension suspicious-code-detector-1.0.0.vsix

# Restart VSCode
# Cmd+Q ‚Üí Reopen
```

**Demo Script:**

1. **Introduction** (1 min)
   - "I'm going to show you a real-world malware detection in action"
   - "This extension mimics patterns from actual malware like ellacrity.recoil"

2. **Installation** (30 sec)
   ```bash
   code --install-extension demo-suspicious-extension-0.1.0.vsix
   ```
   - "Watch what happens when we install this extension..."

3. **Detection** (30 sec)
   - Wait for the alert to pop up
   - "Our scanner detected it immediately!"
   - Point out the severity levels

4. **Investigation** (2 min)
   - Click "View Full Report"
   - Show the findings list
   - Click on a line number to jump to code
   - Point out specific patterns:
     - Unicode steganography
     - Dynamic code execution
     - Command execution

5. **Comparison** (1 min)
   - "This is exactly what ellacrity.recoil did"
   - "It had 1000+ downloads before being caught"
   - "Our scanner would have caught it on day 1"

6. **Cleanup** (30 sec)
   - Click "Uninstall" in the report
   - Or: `code --uninstall-extension demo-publisher.demo-suspicious-extension`

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Auto-Scan on Install
**Purpose:** Test automatic scanning of new extensions

**Steps:**
1. Ensure auto-scan is enabled (it's on by default)
2. Install the demo extension
3. Watch for immediate security alert
4. Verify all findings are detected

**Expected:** Alert appears within 5-10 seconds

### Scenario 2: Manual Extension Scan
**Purpose:** Test on-demand scanning

**Steps:**
1. Install the demo extension (disable auto-scan first)
2. Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "Scan All Installed Extensions"
3. View the report

**Expected:** Extension appears in scan results with all findings

### Scenario 3: File Scanning
**Purpose:** Test direct file analysis

**Steps:**
1. Open `extension.js` in editor
2. Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "Scan Current File"
3. Check Problems panel (Cmd+Shift+M)

**Expected:** All 8-9 issues appear in Problems panel

### Scenario 4: Clickable Links
**Purpose:** Test code navigation

**Steps:**
1. Scan the extension (any method)
2. Open the HTML report
3. Click on `üìç Line XX` links
4. Verify code opens at correct line

**Expected:** Each click opens file at exact line

### Scenario 5: False Positive Check
**Purpose:** Verify Chinese/multilingual code isn't flagged

**Steps:**
1. Install demo extension (has only English code)
2. Compare with `test-chinese-false-positives.js`
3. Verify Chinese comments aren't flagged as homoglyphs

**Expected:** Only actual threats flagged, not legitimate Chinese text

## üìù Presentation Talking Points

### Why This Matters

**Real-World Context:**
- "VSCode extensions have full system access"
- "ellacrity.recoil malware had 1000+ downloads"
- "It stole GitHub tokens from developers"
- "It was invisible in most IDEs"

### What We Detect

**Technical Details:**
- "Unicode Variation Selectors - invisible characters hiding payloads"
- "Dynamic code execution - eval with base64 encoding"
- "Command execution - running system commands"
- "Trojan Source attacks - bidirectional text manipulation"

### How It Works

**Detection Methods:**
- "Pattern matching for known malicious patterns"
- "Statistical analysis of character frequencies"
- "Context-aware to reduce false positives"
- "Real-time scanning with instant alerts"

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Alert Doesn't Appear

**Check:**
1. Is auto-scan enabled?
   - Settings ‚Üí search `autoScanNewExtensions`
   - Should be `true`

2. Is the scanner extension active?
   - Check Extensions panel
   - "Suspicious Code Detector" should show "Enabled"

3. Try manual scan:
   - Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "Scan All Installed Extensions"

### Report Shows No Findings

**Solutions:**
1. Open Developer Console (Help ‚Üí Toggle Developer Tools)
2. Look for `[Security Scanner]` messages
3. Check if extension.js file is readable
4. Try reinstalling demo extension

### Links Don't Work

**Fix:**
1. Make sure you're in the HTML report (not notification)
2. Click directly on `üìç Line XX` text
3. Check file hasn't been deleted

---

## üóëÔ∏è Cleanup

### Uninstall Demo Extension

**Via Command:**
```bash
code --uninstall-extension demo-publisher.demo-suspicious-extension
```

**Via VSCode:**
1. Cmd+Shift+X (Extensions panel)
2. Search: "demo suspicious"
3. Click gear icon ‚Üí Uninstall

**Via Report:**
1. View Extension Scan Report
2. Click "Uninstall" button
3. Confirm

### Verify Removal

```bash
code --list-extensions | grep demo
```

Should return nothing.
