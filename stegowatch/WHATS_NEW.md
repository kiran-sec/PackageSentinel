## 📋 What Gets Detected

Every newly installed extension is automatically scanned for:

| Pattern | Severity | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Unicode Steganography | Critical | 135 invisible chars hiding payload |
| eval(atob(...)) | Critical | Base64 encoded malicious code |
| Trojan Source | Critical | Bidirectional text attacks |
| child_process.exec() | High | Command execution |
| Invisible Characters | Medium | Zero-width spaces |
| Excessive Indentation | Medium | Code hidden off-screen |
